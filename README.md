# Rooterberg

This project contains test vectors, similar to Project Wycheproof. The test vectors here are experimental.
Their format may change. Often the test vectors are not well tested. Likely, I will add these test vectors to
Project Wycheproof, once this project is in a more stable state.

The goal is to receive early feedback on the test vectors, determine if the format is useful, find algorithms and
algorithm parameters that should be covered.

New test vectors are released about once per months. However, there is no fixed schedule.

The test vectors are tested against a number of libraries. The main intent behind the tests is to check
formats. Frequently, libraries do not specify all the algorithm parameters of their primitives.
